                <h2>Research Area 1: Fractional Fourier Transform and Linear Canonical Transform</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT)</strong> and the <strong>Linear Canonical Transform (LCT)</strong> are two generalized signal transforms that extend the classical Fourier framework. The FRFT enables a continuous transition between the time and frequency domains, providing a fractional-domain representation that captures intermediate signal characteristics. The LCT further generalizes the FRFT by introducing additional degrees of freedom, allowing not only rotation but also scaling and shearing in the time–frequency plane. These transforms serve as powerful tools for analyzing non-stationary signals and have broad applications in signal processing, optics, radar imaging, and data analysis.</p>
                
                <h4>(1) Uncertainty Principle and Convolution Theorem</h4>
                <p>The uncertainty principle in LCT and FRFT domains extends classical bounds on signal localization in time and fractional-frequency domains. Research investigates these bounds in complex-valued, Clifford algebra, and spacetime algebra settings. New convolution theorems provide consistent formulations for linear systems analysis and filtering, while generalized convolution operators enable applications in chirp signal filtering and non-stationary system modeling.</p>

                <h4>(2) Sampling Theory</h4>
                <p>LCT-domain sampling theory overcomes band-limited constraints of classical Fourier methods. New sampling theorems enable perfect signal recovery from uniformly or non-uniformly spaced samples. Low-rate sampling methods based on derivatives and Hilbert transforms extend to complex reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, providing efficient digital signal representation.</p>

                <h4>(3) Time–Frequency Analysis Methods</h4>
                <p>LCT-based time–frequency analysis offers greater flexibility and resolution than Fourier methods, with adaptive scaling and improved noise robustness. Representative techniques include the linear canonical Wigner–Ville distribution (LCWVD), linear canonical wavelet transform (LCWT), and windowed linear canonical transform (WLCT) for accurate parameter estimation of non-stationary signals.</p>
                
                <h4>(4) Discretization and Fast Algorithms</h4>
                <p>Efficient discrete implementations of FRFT and LCT include partition-based, sliding-window, and high-resolution fast algorithms. These methods reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy and stability, enabling real-time processing for high-dimensional data and large-scale systems.</p>

                <h4>(5) Applications in Real-World Scenarios</h4>
                <p>FRFT and LCT have been applied in speech signal restoration, radar signal processing for ISAR imaging, optical measurement, and image processing including digital watermarking, color image representation, and image segmentation.</p>

                <h2>Research Area 2: Graph Signal Processing</h2>
                <p>Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is an emerging field that generalizes traditional signal processing concepts to data defined on graphs rather than regular domains such as time or space. By leveraging the topological structure encoded in the graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix, GSP enables the analysis, transformation, and filtering of signals residing on irregular structures, such as social networks, sensor networks, or brain connectivity graphs. This framework extends classical operations such as Fourier transforms, filtering, and sampling to graph domains, providing powerful tools for analyzing complex data with geometric relationships. </p>

                <h4>(1) Graph Fractional Fourier Transform and Graph Linear Canonical Transform</h4>
                <p>The Graph Fractional Fourier Transform (GFRFT) and Graph Linear Canonical Transform (GLCT) extend fractional and canonical transforms to graph signal domains. By incorporating graph Laplacian eigenstructure, these transforms enable flexible analysis in fractional spectral domains, capturing both localized frequency components and geometric relationships. Research focuses on theoretical formulation, uncertainty principles, and applications in spectral graph analysis.</p>

                <h4>(2) Vertex–Frequency Analysis and Graph Filter Design</h4>
                <p>Vertex–frequency analysis jointly characterizes signal variation over graph nodes and spectral components, analogous to time–frequency analysis in classical signal processing. Graph windowed Fourier and wavelet transforms provide fine-grained analysis of localized behaviors. Graph-domain filter design adapts filter kernels to vertex localization and spectral bandwidth, enabling denoising, feature extraction, and anomaly detection on irregular domains.</p>

                <h4>(3) Spectral Graph Neural Networks</h4>
                <p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks integrate deep learning with spectral graph theory, performing convolutional operations in the graph frequency domain. Hybrid models combine GSP-based transforms (e.g., GLCT) with deep learning to enhance interpretability and robustness, capturing both global graph topology and local vertex-level dynamics.</p>

Deep learning, ensemble learning, and adaptive boosting algorithms enhance detection capability. Fractional and canonical domain representations improve discrimination between target and interference signals, with applications in wireless communication, radar sensing, and remote data acquisition.</p>

                <h4>(2) Parameter Estimation and Inference Algorithms</h4>
                <p>Research focuses on adaptive and regularized parameter estimation techniques ensuring numerical stability in noisy, nonstationary, or ill-conditioned environments. Methods such as the Broken Adaptive Ridge (BAR) algorithm and its graph-based extension (GBARA) reduce bias and enhance accuracy. Neural network–based estimators integrate data-driven learning with classical statistical estimation for real-time adaptation.</p>

                <h4>(3) High-Dimensional Covariance Estimation and Invertibility</h4>
                <p>This research develops efficient and stable estimation of covariance and precision matrices for high-dimensional or sparse datasets. Structural information (low-rank, sparse, or block-diagonal patterns) enables accurate reconstruction under limited observations. Graphical modeling and random matrix theory analyze invertibility and improve computational tractability, with applications in multi-sensor fusion, bioinformatics, and financial data analysis.</p>

                <h4>(4) Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h4>
                <p>Research applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to statistical data analysis and signal processing. Topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, neural network optimization, and model interpretability. Deep learning models enable nonlinear feature extraction and pattern recognition, while lightweight algorithms support efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

                <h4>(1) Application of Information Geometry in Target Detection</h4>
                <p>Matrix Information Geometry (MIG) models covariance and correlation matrices as points on a Riemannian manifold.
